This is Kaminskyâ€™s attack (2008)

You need to lure the victim to your own website.
On this website, include pictures from the target website.
Use many subdomains in order to get many requests (like in the slides).
The victim will request all these subdomains.
Race for each query...

It passes the bailiwick check because a DNS reply is authorized to answer for the target website, because the target website was also requested.
