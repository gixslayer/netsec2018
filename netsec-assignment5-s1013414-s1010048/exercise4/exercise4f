We MITM to intercept the HTTP GET request, then make this request ourselves (which gives us the readable/decryptable response), and then forward this response back to the original requesting host.

This way we can read the traffic, as we run HTTP between the client and us, and HTTP/HTTPS between us and the server, all while the client thinks he is directly connected to the server (but using HTTP rather than HTTPS).

It does rewrite traffic, rather than only forwarding, as we want to set up the HTTP(S) connection between us and the server directly.
