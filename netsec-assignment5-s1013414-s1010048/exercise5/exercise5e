Run the services on a local network, which is routed through the vpn. This way when the client tries to send traffic to the other services, it is first ran through the vpn, which then forwards the traffic to the service on the local network.

Basically the idea is that we need a different ip (range) to contact the services, so that we can run this ip (range) over the vpn. We could expand on this using iptables to redirect the traffic to the vpn ip on certain service ports to the new different ip (which is routed via the vpn).
