We see a different route to brightspace and google, as expected, but nothing really interesting. This is because both sites are also quite some hops away from the vpn server.

The cs.ru.nl route is much faster from the vpn, as it is already fairly close.

The route to the VPN server itself is the same, as the traceroute is not ran through the VPN (due to the '131.174.16.141 via 192.168.2.254 dev wlo1' rule).
